# NEOPHYTE TUTORIAL ENVIRONMENT STARTER (test)

## WARNING: This can cost you a bit if you have no free cpu hours on your GitHUB account

Steps:
- create new Codespaces, give it 4 cores to make it faster
- wait until OLLAMA.md appears (2-3 minutes)
- use Shift-WIN-P / Shift-CMD-P and "View creation log" to check the progress
