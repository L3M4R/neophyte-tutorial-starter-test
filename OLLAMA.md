### Question:
```

Why is the sky blue?

```

### Answer:
```

The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight. This process involves the scattering of light waves by small particles in the air. Shorter wavelength light, such as blue light, has shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies, and thus gets scattered more than longer wavelength light. As a result, the blue color dominates the visible spectrum of light we experience on Earth.
